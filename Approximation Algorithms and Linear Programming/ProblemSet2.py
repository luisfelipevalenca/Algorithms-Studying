# ## Problem Set 2
# 
# This problem set will focus on setting up and solving integer linear programming problems. Before starting this problem, we assume that you have already studied the tutorial on setting up  integer linear programming problems in pulp.

# ## Problem 1
# 
# In this problem, you will setup and solve the three coloring problem as a integer linear programming problem.
# 
# The three coloring problem inputs an undirected graph $G$ with vertices $V = \{ 1, \ldots, n\}$ and undirected edges $E$. We are looking to color each vertex one of three colors red, green or blue such that for any edge 
# $(i, j)$ the nodes $i, j$ have different colors. 
# 
# Given a graph, we wish to know if a three coloring is possible and if so, we wish to find the three coloring. Although this problem seems like a toy problem, it has applications to many practical problems in resource allocation and other areas. 
# 
# 
# First, we ask you to setup the three coloring problem as an integer linear program.
# 
# ### Decision variables
# 
# For each vertex $i \in V$, we will use three decision variables $x_i^R, x_i^G$ and $x_i^B$ that 
# indicate whether the vertex if colored red, green or blue, respectively. Note that these are all 
# _binary_ variables taking on $0, 1$ values.
# 
# 
# ### (A) Each vertex can take just one color
# 
# Write down a constraint that says that each vertex must be colored exactly one of three colors: red, green or blue in terms of $x_i^R, x_i^B$ and $x_i^B$.
# 
# 

# YOUR ANSWER HERE

# ### (B) Adjacent vertices cannot be the same color.
# 
# Write down constraints for each edge $(i, j) \in E$ that they  cannot be the same color. **Hint** Write down three constraints that express that the vertices $i,j$ cannot both be green, cannot both be red and cannot both be blue respectively. Translate these requirements into constraints involving $x_i^G, x_j^G$,  $x_i^R, x_j^R$ and 
# $x_i^B, x_j^B$.
# 

# 

# Write a function `encodeAndSolveThreeColoring(n, edge_list)` that given the number of vertices $n \geq 1$ and the list of edges as a list of pairs of vertices `[ (i1, j1), (i2, j2) ..., (im, jm) ] ` returns a tuple  `(flag, color_assignment)` consisting of boolean `flag` and a list `color_assignment`, wherein 
#    - `flag` is `True` if the graph is three colorable and `False` if not.
#    - `color_assignment` is a list of n colors `r`, `g`, or `b` (standing for red, green or blue) where the $i^{th}$ element of the list stands for the color assigned to vertex $i$.
#    
#  Note that the `color_assignment` component of the return value is ignored if `flag` is set to `False`.

# ## Problem 2
# 
# Imagine you are operating a bunch of grocery stores across the country with $n$ store locations numbered $0, \ldots, n-1$ wherein each location $i$ has coordinates $(x_i, y_i)$. The travel distance between locations $i$ and $j$ is given by $d_{i,j} = \sqrt{ (x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2 } $ (the Euclidean distance). 
# 
# You are asked to locate warehouses among these $n$ locations so that for each location $j$, the distance to the closest warehouse is less than some specified limit $R \geq 0$. Of course, you need to minimize the number of warehouses since warehouses are expensive to create and operate.
# 
# 
# In this problem, we will formulate an integer linear program that will solve the problem of finding the minimum number or warehouses and their locations given inputs:
#   - $[ (x_0, y_0), \ldots, (x_{n-1}, y_{n-1}) ]$: the list of coordinates of the locations;
#   - $R > 0$ : the acceptable distance limit from each location to its nearest warehouse.
# 

# ### Example
# 
# Consider the following data for the locations:
# 
# $$\begin{array}{ll}
# \text{Loc.} & \text{Coord} \\ 
# \hline
# 0 & (1, 1) \\ 
# 1 & (1, 2) \\ 
# 2 & (2, 3) \\ 
# 3 & (1, 4) \\ 
# 4 & (5, 1) \\ 
# 5 & (3, 3) \\ 
# 6 & (4, 4) \\ 
# 7  & (1,6) \\ 
# 8 & (0,3) \\ 
# 9 & (3,5)\\
# 10 & (2,4)\\ 
# \end{array}$$
# 
# Suppose we wanted to have $R = 2$ as the distance limit. The optimal solution is to choose locations
# $0, 5, 6, 7$ as the warehouse locations. We show below the four circles of radius $2$ around the 
# chosen locations. Notice that they cover all the points in our dataset.
# 
# ![facility-location-ex-1.png](attachment:facility-location-ex-1.png)
# 
# 

# However, no set of three warehouse locations will cover all points for $R = 2$. Suppose we chose the locations
# $3, 5, 9$ for our warehouse locations, notice that there are uncovered locations.
# ![facility-location-ex-2.png](attachment:facility-location-ex-2.png)

# Let's begin to formulate an ILP to compute the minimum number of warehouses.
# 
# # (A) Identifying Decision Variables
# 
# We will have binary decision variable $w_i$ corresponding to each location $i \in \{ 0, \ldots, n-1\}$ wherein 
# 
# $$ w_i = \begin{cases} 1, & \text{if we locate a warehouse at location}\ i \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \\ \end{cases}$$
# 
# ### (B) Objective function
# 
# Express the number of warehouses created in terms of the decision variables $w_0, \ldots, w_{n-1}$. This will give us the objective that we will minimize.
# 

# YOUR ANSWER HERE

# ## (C) Constraints
# 
# Let's consider from the point of view of each location $j$ in our list. We would like at least one warehouse to be located at a location $i$ where $d_{i,j} \leq R$. 
# 
# Define the set  $D_j = \{ i \ |\ d_{i,j} \leq R \}$ to be all locations within distance $R$ from $j$ (this set includes $j$ as well since $d_{j,j} = 0$).
# 
# Write down the constraint that at least one warehouse must be located  among the locations in the set $D_j$.

# YOUR ANSWER HERE

# ### (D) Formulate and solve the ILP given data.
# 
# Write a function `solve_warehouse_location(location_coords, R)` wherein `location_coords` is a list of coordinates
# $[(x_0,y_0), \ldots, (x_{n-1},y_{n-1})]$ and $R > 0$ is the distance limit.  For your convenience, the `euclidean_distance` between two points is implemented. Setup and solve the ILP using PULP.
# 
# Your code should return a list of indices $[i_1, i_2, ..., i_k]$ which are the optimal locations for the warehouses to be located minimizing the number of warehouses and ensuring that every point is within distance $d$ of a warehouse.
